The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta.

It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money.
