Italy needs people who don't always say no.\"\nCritics have accused the 40-year-old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power.\nThey complain that the law awards too much power to single parties, gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates, and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives. Opposition parties boycotted Monday's vote.\nRenato Brunetta, parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party Forza Italia, said afterwards that it was \"a very ugly day for our country's democracy\".\nMr Renzi wants to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-elected body with lesser powers.\nCurrently, legislation is often held up because identical versions of bills have to be approved by both houses.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> italy's prime minister matteo renzi has won the latest stage in a vote in italy's parliament.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Yes": "1"}, "reason": {"Too trivial (only repeating one of the sentences)": "4", "None (only if the previous answer is Yes)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 12s "}}
