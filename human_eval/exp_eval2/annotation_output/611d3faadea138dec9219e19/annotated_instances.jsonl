There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.\nHe said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\n\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\n\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"\nThe commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.\nA Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".\nHe added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\n\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> the scottish government has been accused of no magic bullet'' in the system of a tax on the system.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Weakly No": "3"}, "reason": {"Insufficient justification": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 2s "}}
