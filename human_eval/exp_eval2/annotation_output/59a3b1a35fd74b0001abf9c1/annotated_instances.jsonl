be it the police or anybody else.\"\nChairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, was killed, said: \"This is definitely the start of the end.\n\"I think everybody needs that, I think we all need peace from Hillsborough but we can never have peace until we've got truth, justice, accountability.\n\"I think that's the time we'll all have peace.\"\nBarry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, was killed in the disaster, said: \"Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him.\"\nEvelyn McDonnell Mills, whose brother Peter McDonnell, 21, died, said she was \"really happy\", but sad that her brother who campaigned for years and died during the new inquests never got to see their conclusion.\nPete Weatherby QC, who represents 22 of the victims' families, said they had \"always known that accountability is the most difficult objective\".\n\"They remain keen to see the criminal process properly pursued for those who have been charged and given that, the rights of the defendants should be respected.\n\"They do however hope that the memories of their loved ones and the integrity of the fans who attended Hillsborough will be respected during the process.\"\nBBC News profiles of all those who died\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said: \"I know from working closely with the families when I was home secretary that this will be a day of mixed emotions for them.\"\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn offered a \"tribute to all of those that spent a great deal of time trying to ensure there was justice for those that died at Hillsborough\".\nDr Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, said he hoped the start of criminal proceedings would \"lead to a measure of closure for the family members who have experienced a long and traumatic process\".\nSheffield Wednesday said the club had no comment to make.\nMr Duckenfield and Mr Denton's legal representative Ian Lewis, from JMW Solicitors, said: \"In light of the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to commence criminal proceedings against David Duckenfield and Donald Denton, it would be inappropriate for me as their solicitor, or for my clients themselves, to make any comment.\"\nMr Metcalf declined to comment.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> A police officer has been charged with the manslaughter of a man who was injured in the hillsborough disaster.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Weakly Yes": "2"}, "reason": {"Irrelevant to the task": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 25s "}}

{"id": "331", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> hull fc earned their first win of the season in the premier league with a narrow victory over southampton in the first leg of their league play-off semi-final.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat.\nThe hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes.\nFirst, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster.\nSouthampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time.\nThe win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury.\nBut his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it.\nInstantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction.\nThe mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years.\nThat run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768.\nEmpty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players.\nYet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour.\nSouthampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges.\nAustin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge.\nVirgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark.\nThat was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire.\nThe Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort.\nDawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar.\nHull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough.\n\"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character.\n\"Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation.\n\"After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future.\n\"We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.\"\nFollowing the international break, Hull return to action with a trip to bottom side Sunderland on Saturday, 19 November (15:00 GMT), while on the same day Southampton play host to leaders Liverpool, also at 15:00.\nMatch ends, Hull City 2, Southampton 1.\nSecond Half ends, Hull City 2, Southampton 1.\nDelay over.
