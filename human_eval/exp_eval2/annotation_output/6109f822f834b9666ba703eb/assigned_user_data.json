producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d\nThis appeared to be an impossible demand.\nSteve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks

I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article.

In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence.
