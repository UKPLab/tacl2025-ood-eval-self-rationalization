I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said.\nHe said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so.\n'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview\nBBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell\nThe recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him.\nIn the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response.\nHe accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart\".\nAn indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions.\nIt was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself.\nThere was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be.\nWhen asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me\".\nFull details of Queen's birthday celebrations\nTen stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family.\nThe picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year.\nSix further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role.\nOn her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance.\nIt was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months.\nIn the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday.\nOn Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle.\nBritain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June.\nRepublic said the Queen's birthday \"does not warrant this kind of coverage\" and that the BBC had a \"duty to report, not to celebrate the royals\".\nGraham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had \"failed completely\" to report the birthday in a way that was \"fair, balanced and proportionate\".<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> prince william has said it is incredibly important''to be the queen's 90th birthday.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Weakly No": "3"}, "reason": {"Does not make sense (nonsensical)": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 59s "}}
