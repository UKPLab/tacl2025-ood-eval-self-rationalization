Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane.\nFollowing Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\"\nThe UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.\nThese will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> the world's first satellite to track flight data from the missing malaysia airlines flight mh370 has been given the go-ahead.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"No": "4"}, "reason": {"Too trivial (only repeating one of the sentences)": "4", "Contain hallucinated content (not present in the premise)": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}
