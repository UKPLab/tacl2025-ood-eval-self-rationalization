Thursday.\nThe battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time.\n\"Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest \u2026 is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,\" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday.\nAhead of elections in May 2015
