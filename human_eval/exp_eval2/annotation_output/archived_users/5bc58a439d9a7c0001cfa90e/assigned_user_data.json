access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial.\n\"We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault.\n\"Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone.\n\"Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr
