{"id": "6", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.\n\u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d\nThis appeared to be an impossible demand.\nSteve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.\nThen I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence.

Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base.\n\"For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nIn his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election.\n\"Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,\" Bility wrote.\n\"If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down \u2026 with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes.\"\nBility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check.\nOn Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same.\nAlongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president.\nThe election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> the row has broken out over whether sepp blatter should be replaced by a member of world governing body fifa.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"No": "4"}, "reason": {"Insufficient justification": "2", "Too trivial (only repeating one of the sentences)": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 18s "}}
