Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx.\"\nThe West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media.\nSince he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd.\nThe teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond.\nThe Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell.\nOn Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell.\nJak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson.\nThe teenager wrote on his page: \"I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again.\n\"I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.\n\"Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.\"\nAt the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity.\nThe Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months.\nHe was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked.\nJak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school.\nOn 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment.\nAt the time, Jak wrote: \"This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have.\n\"I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it.\n\"I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me.\"\nIn the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research.\nAfter becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike.\nMore money is expected to be raised for charity on Sunday at a special football match being held at the Energy Assets Arena, home of Livingston FC.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> jak trueman, 15, was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer called gamma delta T-cell lymphoma last august. he briefly attended a school prom held in his honour on saturday.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Weakly Yes": "2"}, "reason": {"Insufficient justification": "2", "Contain hallucinated content (not present in the premise)": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 32s "}}

Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.\n\"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\"\nScottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime.\nA study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.\nHalf of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed.\nA third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.\nLead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades.\n\"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\"\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.\n\"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a \u00c2\u00a3296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> boys from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Weakly Yes": "2"}, "reason": {"Too trivial (only repeating one of the sentences)": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 54s "}}

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> the all progressives congress (APC) has won elections in nigeria's presidential election.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Yes": "1"}, "reason": {"Too trivial (only repeating one of the sentences)": "4", "Contain hallucinated content (not present in the premise)": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 29s "}}
