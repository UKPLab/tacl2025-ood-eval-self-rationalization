Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base.\n\"For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nIn his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election.\n\"Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,\" Bility wrote.\n\"If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down \u2026 with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes.\"\nBility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check.\nOn Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same.\nAlongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president.\nThe election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> none", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Weakly Yes": "2"}, "reason": {"Does not make sense (nonsensical)": "1", "None (only if the previous answer is Yes)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 40s "}}
