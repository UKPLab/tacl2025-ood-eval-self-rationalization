Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.\n\"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\"\nScottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime.\nA study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.\nHalf of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed.\nA third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.\nLead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades.\n\"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\"\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.\n\"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a \u00c2\u00a3296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"No": "4"}, "reason": {"Insufficient justification": "2", "Too trivial (only repeating one of the sentences)": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 18s "}}
