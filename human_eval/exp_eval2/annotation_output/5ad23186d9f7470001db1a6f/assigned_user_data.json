increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls.\nThe government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live.\nThe study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers.\nThey found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18.\nPoorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts.\nAnd household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending.\nThis was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said.\nThey found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime.\nThe study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts.\nGirls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said.\nThis was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account.\nThe findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal.\nThe study has tracked 4,300 young people in
