We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen.\"\nMr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK.\nHe said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome \"might come today, it might come next week\".\nThere was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added.\nMr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was \"more fight in her\" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas.\nHe told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was \"unpredictable\" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased.\nSpeaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: \"I have watched her grow up on Skype.\n\"She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English.\n\"Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing.\"\nMr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter.\nAmnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a \"prisoner of conscience\" who was being held for \"peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association\".\nRisk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: \"Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> nazanin zaghari-ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail for allegedly plotting to topple the government in tehran. her husband has criticised the uk government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in \"secret\".", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"No": "4"}, "reason": {"Too trivial (only repeating one of the sentences)": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 54s "}}
