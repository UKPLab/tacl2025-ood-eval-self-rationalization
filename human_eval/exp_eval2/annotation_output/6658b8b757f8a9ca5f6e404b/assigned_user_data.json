But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.\nThe UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.\nThe question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?\nDuring the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.\nThat right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.\nThe use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.\nOver centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.\nBut government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.\nOne such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.\nThe government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is \"entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice\".\nCritics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThey say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.\nLawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.\nIt would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.\nGrahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the \"enforced removal\" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be \"completely unprecedented\" in a modern democracy.\n\"I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away,\" he says.\nLawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.\nThe chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a \"shock\".\nHe is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.\nHe states: \"If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France.\"\nHis lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens \"beyond these shores\" are so fundamental that legislation is \"required\" to take them away.\nBut in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.\nThe Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.\nThere will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.\nIn their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the \"clear understanding\" that the outcome of the referendum would be \"respected\".\nIf Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to \"give effect to the will and decision of the people\".\nConservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: \"To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate.\"\nBut lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an \"advisory\" referendum - not a binding one.\nThey state: \"Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result.\"\nThe biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.\nThey says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.\nSir Bill Cash said: \"We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.\n\"That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court.\"\nLord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.\nMark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.\n\"If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law.\"\nPutting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.\nGina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against \"prerogative creep\".\n\"The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty.\"\nIf the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.\nThe majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.\nBut would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?\nMost members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.\nIf the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.\nIt raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> the uk is on course for exit from the eu, but the law does not say whether it will be triggered by parliament."}, "213": {"id": "213", "text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> A little boy is running on the ground and playing with a little girl<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> The kids are not chasing each other in the sand<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> neutral<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> a little boy is running on the ground and playing with a little girl.", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> A little boy is running on the ground and playing with a little girl<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> The kids are not chasing each other in the sand<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> neutral<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> a little boy is running on the ground and playing with a little girl."}, "873": {"id": "873", "text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Several people are in front of a colorful building<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> Several people are in front of a building which is covered by colors<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The building is covered by colors, but it is not colorful.", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Several people are in front of a colorful building<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> Several people are in front of a building which is covered by colors<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The building is covered by colors, but it is not colorful."}, "356": {"id": "356", "text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The album Confessions of a Dangerous Mind features Eminem , who is from Detroit .<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> The album \u2019 s third single , \u201c Homicide \u201d was released on May 3 , and featured a guest verse from rap god Eminem.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> neutral<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> the album confessions of a dangerous mind features eminem, who is from detroit.", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The album Confessions of a Dangerous Mind features Eminem , who is from Detroit .<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> The album \u2019 s third single , \u201c Homicide \u201d was released on May 3 , and featured a guest verse from rap god Eminem.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> neutral<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> the album confessions of a dangerous mind features eminem, who is from detroit."}, "Explanation-Evaluation-end.html": {"id": "Explanation-Evaluation-end.html", "text": "end", "displayed_text": "end"}}
