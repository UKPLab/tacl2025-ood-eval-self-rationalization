lowest-ranked side left after Westfields' exit on Monday.\nCentre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams.\nBut the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13.\nTaunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession.\nWilliams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over.\nBut Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards.\nPalmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner.\nBut Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah,
