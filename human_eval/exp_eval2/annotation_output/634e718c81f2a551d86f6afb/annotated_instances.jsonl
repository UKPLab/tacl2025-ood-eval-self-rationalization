I have an apple. Apple-pen!\nI have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen!\nApple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen.\"\nBut how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple?\n\"When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,\" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character.\nIt has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up.\nAnd it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook.\nWhile the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views.\n\"I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,\" lamented Facebook user Carlos Andr\u00c3\u00a9s Silva in a comment.\nNelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. \"I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused.\"\nOther users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe.\n\"Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,\" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character.\nBut one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden.\n\"Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,\" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea.\nAt time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media.\nHe has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon.\nBut the hype did not stop there.\nHundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own.\nMany Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own.\nThere's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.\nWhat a time to be alive.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> dj piko-taro has been hit by a viral video on social media.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Yes": "1"}, "reason": {"None (only if the previous answer is Yes)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 7s "}}

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry.\nWithin this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach.\nMy recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry.\nI exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000.\nAE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The exhibition titled 'Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell' features labels from the Indian matchbox industry.
