and perpetrators - of crime.\nThe study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts.\nGirls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said.\nThis was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account.\nThe findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal.\nThe study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles.\nIt has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government.\nReport author Prof Lesley McAra said: \"Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic -
