Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people.\nLabour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited.\nMr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: \"People are angry and I share that anger.\"\nDowning Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed.\nBut Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: \"Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV.\"\nThe prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the \"professionalism and bravery\" of the emergency services.\nShe pledged that the government \"stands ready to provide every assistance\" to the council and emergency services.\n\"I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home.\"\nShe has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected.\nBut MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended.\nAt the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: \"What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy.\"\nHe said the \"exceptionally complex\" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for \"plodding bureaucracy\" in the official response.\n\"It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,\" he said.\nAnswers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said.\n\"Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried.\"\nShadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry.\nThe new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety.\nThe government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said.\nAt the end of the meeting, he promised \"every single family\" would be re-housed in the local area.\nEarlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, \"to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated\".\nLabour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately.\nRecommendations made after a fire in a tower block in Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations.\nIn October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had \"publicly committed\" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire.\nMr Healey said this review had \"not been started\".\n\"The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,\" he said.\nResponding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was \"simply not true\" that a report about building regulations had been \"sat on\".\nThe BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry.\nHe or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness.\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> jeremy corbyn has said he is \"very angry\" that so many lives were lost in a deadly tower block fire.

{"id": "136", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> st johnstone eased to victory over 10-man inverness caledonian thistle to move off the bottom of the scottish premiership.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone.\nICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second.\nDanny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish.\nInverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership.\nTheir rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box.\nWhen skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead.\nInjuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence.\nSt Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals.\nIt was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal.\nOverall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves.\nThere was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead.\nThey might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away.\nSt Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick.\nSwanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory.\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems.\n\"Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well.\n\"Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.\"\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season.\n\"You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clich\u00e9s, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today.\n\"I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games.\n\"But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).
