{"id": "791", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> italy's lower house of parliament has passed a controversial parliamentary reform of the country's electoral system.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> The measure guarantees a majority of seats to the party that wins the most votes in an election.\nIt is a key element of a package of reforms promised by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.\nThe law seeks to end Italy's post-war era of revolving governments, political horse-trading and unstable coalitions.\nThe lower house of parliament gave final approval to the bill by 334 votes to 61.\nThe proportional election system awards 340 out of 630 seats to any party that wins more than 40% of the national vote.\nIf no party reaches that threshold, there is a second-round run-off between the two parties with the most votes.\nThe electoral reform is expected to come into force next year.\nAfter the vote, Mr Renzi said: \"Commitment achieved, promise respected. Italy needs people who don't always say no.\"\nCritics have accused the 40-year-old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power.\nThey complain that the law awards too much power to single parties, gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates, and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives. Opposition parties boycotted Monday's vote.\nRenato Brunetta, parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party Forza Italia, said afterwards that it was \"a very ugly day for our country's democracy\".\nMr Renzi wants to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-elected body with lesser powers.\nCurrently, legislation is often held up because identical versions of bills have to be approved by both houses.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong> italy's lower house of parliament has passed a controversial parliamentary reform of the country's electoral system.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Yes": "1"}, "reason": {"None (only if the previous answer is Yes)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 14s "}}
