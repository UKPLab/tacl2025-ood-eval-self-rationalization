Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people.\nLabour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited.\nMr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: \"People are angry and I share that anger.\"\nDowning Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed.\nBut Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: \"Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents.
