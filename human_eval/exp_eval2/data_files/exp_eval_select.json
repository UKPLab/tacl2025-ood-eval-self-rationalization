I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> The iPhone has been a success."}

{"id":"21","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in the early hours of tuesday morning, cynthia garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, kenya's capital, garissa.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst.\nThe sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears.\nCynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia.\nThere have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings.\nBut when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure.\n\"I'm fine, thanks.\"\n\"Everything is fine now.\"\n\"Thank you for asking.\"\nI am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable.\nI couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women.\nThese feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity.\nThey are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border.\nBut elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality.\nAl-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back.\nPerhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax.\nAt Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: \"Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.\"\nAnd yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon.\nFor two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy.\nBut Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya.\nThen, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast.\nTroops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with \"friendly\" warlords.\nSince then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya.\nRevenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere.\nThen there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation.\nIt has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast.\nAnd then there is Greater Somalia.\nIt is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa.\nAl-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges.\nBy attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area.\nNot that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite.\nYes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town.\nSurely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support.\nBut overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> In the early hours of tuesday morning, Cynthia Garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, Kenya's capital."}

Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.\n\"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\"\nScottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime.\nA study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.\nHalf of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed.\nA third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.\nLead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades.\n\"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\"\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.\n\"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a \u00c2\u00a3296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> The study found that young people in Edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research."}

{"id":"37","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.\n\u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d\nThis appeared to be an impossible demand.\nSteve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.\nThen I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> steve jobs has not been a success."}

Croft Solicitors is representing the expats.\nSuperstar of the bar\" Lord Pannick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller's case while the government is turning to an old favourite, James Eadie QC.\nAttorney General Jeremy Wright QC, the government's legal adviser, will also play a big role.\nHe said: \"There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to re-join it through the back door, and no second referendum.\n\"We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that.\"\nIn political terms, the UK is on course for departure from the EU. But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.\nThe UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.\nThe question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?\nDuring the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.\nThat right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.\nThe use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.\nOver centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.\nBut government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.\nOne such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.\nThe government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is \"entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice\".\nCritics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThey say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.\nLawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.\nIt would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.\nGrahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the \"enforced removal\" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be \"completely unprecedented\" in a modern democracy.\n\"I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away,\" he says.\nLawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.\nThe chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a \"shock\".\nHe is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.\nHe states: \"If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France.\"\nHis lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens \"beyond these shores\" are so fundamental that legislation is \"required\" to take them away.\nBut in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.\nThe Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.\nThere will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.\nIn their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the \"clear understanding\" that the outcome of the referendum would be \"respected\".\nIf Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to \"give effect to the will and decision of the people\".\nConservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: \"To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate.\"\nBut lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an \"advisory\" referendum - not a binding one.\nThey state: \"Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result.\"\nThe biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.\nThey says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.\nSir Bill Cash said: \"We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.\n\"That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court.\"\nLord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.\nMark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.\n\"If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law.\"\nPutting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.\nGina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against \"prerogative creep\".\n\"The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty.\"\nIf the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.\nThe majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.\nBut would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?\nMost members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.\nIf the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.\nIt raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the uk is on course for exit from the eu, but the law does not say whether it should be activated by parliament."}

{"id":"105","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in the early hours of tuesday morning, cynthia garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, kenya's capital, garissa.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst.\nThe sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears.\nCynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia.\nThere have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings.\nBut when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure.\n\"I'm fine, thanks.\"\n\"Everything is fine now.\"\n\"Thank you for asking.\"\nI am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable.\nI couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women.\nThese feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity.\nThey are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border.\nBut elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality.\nAl-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back.\nPerhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax.\nAt Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: \"Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.\"\nAnd yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon.\nFor two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy.\nBut Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya.\nThen, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast.\nTroops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with \"friendly\" warlords.\nSince then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya.\nRevenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere.\nThen there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation.\nIt has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast.\nAnd then there is Greater Somalia.\nIt is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa.\nAl-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges.\nBy attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area.\nNot that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite.\nYes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town.\nSurely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support.\nBut overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> Cynthia Garissa woke up in her bedroom in Garissa, Kenya's capital, on the early hours of tuesday morning, in May, 2015."}

It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> indian matchbox labels are on display in the western state of maharashtra for the first time."}

Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people.\nLabour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited.\nMr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: \"People are angry and I share that anger.\"\nDowning Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed.\nBut Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: \"Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV.\"\nThe prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the \"professionalism and bravery\" of the emergency services.\nShe pledged that the government \"stands ready to provide every assistance\" to the council and emergency services.\n\"I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home.\"\nShe has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected.\nBut MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended.\nAt the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: \"What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy.\"\nHe said the \"exceptionally complex\" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for \"plodding bureaucracy\" in the official response.\n\"It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,\" he said.\nAnswers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said.\n\"Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried.\"\nShadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry.\nThe new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety.\nThe government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said.\nAt the end of the meeting, he promised \"every single family\" would be re-housed in the local area.\nEarlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, \"to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated\".\nLabour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately.\nRecommendations made after a fire in a tower block in Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations.\nIn October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had \"publicly committed\" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire.\nMr Healey said this review had \"not been started\".\n\"The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,\" he said.\nResponding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was \"simply not true\" that a report about building regulations had been \"sat on\".\nThe BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry.\nHe or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness.\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> The former is not the same as the police."}

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> The All Progressives Congress (APC) has won elections in nigeria's presidential election."}

Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.\n\"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\"\nScottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime.\nA study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.\nHalf of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed.\nA third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.\nLead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades.\n\"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\"\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.\n\"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a \u00c2\u00a3296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> boys from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls."}

{"id":"266","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> st johnstone eased to victory over 10-man inverness caledonian thistle to move off the bottom of the scottish premiership.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone.\nICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second.\nDanny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish.\nInverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership.\nTheir rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box.\nWhen skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead.\nInjuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence.\nSt Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals.\nIt was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal.\nOverall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves.\nThere was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead.\nThey might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away.\nSt Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick.\nSwanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory.\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems.\n\"Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well.\n\"Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.\"\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season.\n\"You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clich\u00e9s, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today.\n\"I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games.\n\"But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

{"id":"288","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> st johnstone eased to victory over 10-man inverness caledonian thistle to move off the bottom of the scottish premiership.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone.\nICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second.\nDanny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish.\nInverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership.\nTheir rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box.\nWhen skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead.\nInjuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence.\nSt Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals.\nIt was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal.\nOverall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves.\nThere was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead.\nThey might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away.\nSt Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick.\nSwanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory.\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems.\n\"Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well.\n\"Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.\"\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season.\n\"You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clich\u00e9s, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today.\n\"I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games.\n\"But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

{"id":"292","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> it is the word of the uk's membership of the eu's membership of the eu, but it is not exactly where it is going to be the next parliament.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> On Thursday, an investment manager and hairdresser will challenge the right of the government to start the process of withdrawing the UK from the EU without a vote in Parliament.\nLawyers will question whether Prime Minister Theresa May is entitled to act unilaterally, using powers left over from the days of medieval monarchs.\nIt could end up - in theory - with Parliament being given a means to stop Brexit.\nSo as constitutional rows go, it is box office stuff.\nOr as professor of public law at Cambridge University, Mark Elliott, puts it: \"I don't rule out the possibility of the government losing the case.\"\nLeading the fight against the government is Gina Miller, who runs an investment firm in London, SCM Private.\nShe argues that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her \"rights\" under EU law.\nShe is confident she has a strong case and is undaunted by criticism.\n\"I do not back away from a fight,\" she says. \"I'm very vocal about things and I'm no stranger to making enemies.\"\nShe is joined by London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.\nAlso weighing into the case against the government is the group, Fair Deal for Expats.\nAround two million British citizens are believed to live and work in other EU countries.\nThe Brexit terms have not been decided but expats - some of whom were barred from voting in the referendum - fear potential repatriation and are worried about the impact on their jobs and homes as well as the ramifications for healthcare, their children's schooling and pensions.\nThree London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - have agreed to take up the case. Croft Solicitors is representing the expats.\nSuperstar of the bar\" Lord Pannick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller's case while the government is turning to an old favourite, James Eadie QC.\nAttorney General Jeremy Wright QC, the government's legal adviser, will also play a big role.\nHe said: \"There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to re-join it through the back door, and no second referendum.\n\"We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that.\"\nIn political terms, the UK is on course for departure from the EU. But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.\nThe UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.\nThe question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?\nDuring the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.\nThat right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.\nThe use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.\nOver centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.\nBut government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.\nOne such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.\nThe government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is \"entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice\".\nCritics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThey say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.\nLawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.\nIt would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.\nGrahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the \"enforced removal\" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be \"completely unprecedented\" in a modern democracy.\n\"I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away,\" he says.\nLawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.\nThe chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a \"shock\".\nHe is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.\nHe states: \"If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France.\"\nHis lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens \"beyond these shores\" are so fundamental that legislation is \"required\" to take them away.\nBut in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.\nThe Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.\nThere will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.\nIn their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the \"clear understanding\" that the outcome of the referendum would be \"respected\".\nIf Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to \"give effect to the will and decision of the people\".\nConservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: \"To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate.\"\nBut lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an \"advisory\" referendum - not a binding one.\nThey state: \"Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result.\"\nThe biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.\nThey says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.\nSir Bill Cash said: \"We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.\n\"That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court.\"\nLord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.\nMark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.\n\"If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law.\"\nPutting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.\nGina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against \"prerogative creep\".\n\"The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty.\"\nIf the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.\nThe majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.\nBut would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?\nMost members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.\nIf the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.\nIt raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the uk is on course for exit from the eu, but it is not exactly where it is going to be the next parliament."}

It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films.

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry.\nWithin this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach.\nMy recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry.\nI exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000.\nAE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> Just because My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry does not mean it is in the western state of maharashtra for the first time."}

Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.\n\"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\"\nScottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime.\nA study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.\nHalf of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed.\nA third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.\nLead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades.\n\"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\"\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.\n\"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a \u00c2\u00a3296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> none"}

There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.\nHe said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\n\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\n\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"\nThe commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.\nA Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".\nHe added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\n\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the scottish government has been accused of no magic bullet'' in the system of a tax on the system."}

We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough.\n\"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character.\n\"Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation.\n\"After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration.

I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the iphone has been a success, but steve jobs has not."}

Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected.\nBut MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended.\nAt the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: \"What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy.\"\nHe said the \"exceptionally complex\" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for \"plodding bureaucracy\" in the official response.\n\"It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,\" he said.\nAnswers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said.\n\"Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried.\"\nShadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry.\nThe new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety.\nThe government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said.\nAt the end of the meeting, he promised \"every single family\" would be re-housed in the local area.\nEarlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, \"to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated\".\nLabour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately.\nRecommendations made after a fire in a tower block in Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations.\nIn October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had \"publicly committed\" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire.\nMr Healey said this review had \"not been started\".\n\"The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,\" he said.\nResponding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was \"simply not true\" that a report about building regulations had been \"sat on\".\nThe BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry.\nHe or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness.\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> jeremy corbyn has said he is \"very angry\" that so many lives were lost in a deadly tower block fire.

Italy needs people who don't always say no.\"\nCritics have accused the 40-year-old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power.\nThey complain that the law awards too much power to single parties, gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates, and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives. Opposition parties boycotted Monday's vote.\nRenato Brunetta, parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party Forza Italia, said afterwards that it was \"a very ugly day for our country's democracy\".\nMr Renzi wants to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-elected body with lesser powers.\nCurrently, legislation is often held up because identical versions of bills have to be approved by both houses.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the measure guarantees a majority of seats to the party that wins the most votes in an election."}

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry.\nWithin this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach.\nMy recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry.\nI exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000.\nAE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> india's famous bollywood labels are on display in the western state of maharashtra."}

I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> steve jobs has been a success."}

It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s.

Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> none"}

{"id":"500","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in the early hours of tuesday morning, cynthia garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, kenya's capital, garissa.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst.\nThe sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears.\nCynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia.\nThere have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings.\nBut when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure.\n\"I'm fine, thanks.\"\n\"Everything is fine now.\"\n\"Thank you for asking.\"\nI am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable.\nI couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women.\nThese feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity.\nThey are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border.\nBut elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality.\nAl-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back.\nPerhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax.\nAt Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: \"Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.\"\nAnd yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon.\nFor two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy.\nBut Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya.\nThen, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast.\nTroops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with \"friendly\" warlords.\nSince then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya.\nRevenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere.\nThen there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation.\nIt has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast.\nAnd then there is Greater Somalia.\nIt is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa.\nAl-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges.\nBy attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area.\nNot that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite.\nYes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town.\nSurely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support.\nBut overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> Waking up in the early hours of the morning does not necessarily indicate that it is tuesday morning."}

We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough.\n\"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character.\n\"Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation.\n\"After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration.

I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> The iPhone has been a success, however it has not been making headlines 'time at this time of year."}

Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box.\nWhen skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead.\nInjuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence.\nSt Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals.\nIt was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal.\nOverall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves.\nThere was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead.\nThey might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away.\nSt Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick.\nSwanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory.\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems.\n\"Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well.\n\"Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.\"\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season.\n\"You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clich\u00e9s, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today.\n\"I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games.\n\"But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the all progressives congress (APC) has won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections."}

{"id":"613","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.\n\u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d\nThis appeared to be an impossible demand.\nSteve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.\nThen I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> The iphone t in the Park has been making headlines time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success."}

{"id":"663","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.\n\u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d\nThis appeared to be an impossible demand.\nSteve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.\nThen I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> steve jobs has been a success, however it does not say whether he has been a success in the context."}

Croft Solicitors is representing the expats.\nSuperstar of the bar\" Lord Pannick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller's case while the government is turning to an old favourite, James Eadie QC.\nAttorney General Jeremy Wright QC, the government's legal adviser, will also play a big role.\nHe said: \"There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to re-join it through the back door, and no second referendum.\n\"We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that.\"\nIn political terms, the UK is on course for departure from the EU. But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.\nThe UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.\nThe question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?\nDuring the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.\nThat right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.\nThe use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.\nOver centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.\nBut government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.\nOne such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.\nThe government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is \"entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice\".\nCritics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThey say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.\nLawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.\nIt would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.\nGrahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the \"enforced removal\" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be \"completely unprecedented\" in a modern democracy.\n\"I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away,\" he says.\nLawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.\nThe chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a \"shock\".\nHe is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.\nHe states: \"If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France.\"\nHis lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens \"beyond these shores\" are so fundamental that legislation is \"required\" to take them away.\nBut in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.\nThe Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.\nThere will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.\nIn their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the \"clear understanding\" that the outcome of the referendum would be \"respected\".\nIf Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to \"give effect to the will and decision of the people\".\nConservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: \"To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate.\"\nBut lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an \"advisory\" referendum - not a binding one.\nThey state: \"Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result.\"\nThe biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.\nThey says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.\nSir Bill Cash said: \"We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.\n\"That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court.\"\nLord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.\nMark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.\n\"If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law.\"\nPutting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.\nGina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against \"prerogative creep\".\n\"The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty.\"\nIf the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.\nThe majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.\nBut would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?\nMost members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.\nIf the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.\nIt raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the uk is on course for exit from the eu, but the law does not say whether it will be triggered by parliament."}

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry.\nWithin this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach.\nMy recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry.\nI exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000.\nAE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films.

Croft Solicitors is representing the expats.\nSuperstar of the bar\" Lord Pannick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller's case while the government is turning to an old favourite, James Eadie QC.\nAttorney General Jeremy Wright QC, the government's legal adviser, will also play a big role.\nHe said: \"There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to re-join it through the back door, and no second referendum.\n\"We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that.\"\nIn political terms, the UK is on course for departure from the EU. But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.\nThe UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.\nThe question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?\nDuring the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.\nThat right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.\nThe use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.\nOver centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.\nBut government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.\nOne such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.\nThe government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is \"entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice\".\nCritics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThey say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.\nLawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.\nIt would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.\nGrahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the \"enforced removal\" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be \"completely unprecedented\" in a modern democracy.\n\"I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away,\" he says.\nLawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.\nThe chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a \"shock\".\nHe is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.\nHe states: \"If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France.\"\nHis lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens \"beyond these shores\" are so fundamental that legislation is \"required\" to take them away.\nBut in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.\nThe Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.\nThere will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.\nIn their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the \"clear understanding\" that the outcome of the referendum would be \"respected\".\nIf Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to \"give effect to the will and decision of the people\".\nConservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: \"To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate.\"\nBut lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an \"advisory\" referendum - not a binding one.\nThey state: \"Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result.\"\nThe biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.\nThey says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.\nSir Bill Cash said: \"We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.\n\"That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court.\"\nLord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.\nMark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.\n\"If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law.\"\nPutting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.\nGina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against \"prerogative creep\".\n\"The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty.\"\nIf the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.\nThe majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.\nBut would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?\nMost members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.\nIf the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.\nIt raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> Just because the right of the government to start the process of withdrawing the UK from the EU without a vote in Parliament is being challenged does not mean that the government's bid to stay in the EU has been launched."}

{"id":"827","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> hull fc earned their first win of the season in the premier league with a narrow victory over southampton in the first leg of their league play-off semi-final.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat.\nThe hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes.\nFirst, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster.\nSouthampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time.\nThe win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury.\nBut his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it.\nInstantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction.\nThe mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years.\nThat run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768.\nEmpty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players.\nYet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour.\nSouthampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges.\nAustin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge.\nVirgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark.\nThat was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire.\nThe Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort.\nDawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar.\nHull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough.\n\"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character.\n\"Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation.\n\"After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future.\n\"We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult.

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> none"}

{"id":"851","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.\n\u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d\nThis appeared to be an impossible demand.\nSteve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.\nThen I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> The iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success."}

{"id":"880","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> nigeria's main opposition party, the main opposition party (biggest), has won elections in nigeria's presidential election.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections.\nIt is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999.\nIt lost the presidential poll last month for the first time.\nAPC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan.\nThe PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja.\nThe party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo.\nIt also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency.\nHowever, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub.\nThe PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east.\nTaraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory.\nElections were not held in seven states.\nAnalysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja\nThe APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the all progressives congress (APC) has won elections in nigeria's presidential election."}

{"id":"931","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in the early hours of tuesday morning, cynthia garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, kenya's capital, garissa.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst.\nThe sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears.\nCynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia.\nThere have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings.\nBut when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure.\n\"I'm fine, thanks.\"\n\"Everything is fine now.\"\n\"Thank you for asking.\"\nI am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable.\nI couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women.\nThese feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity.\nThey are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border.\nBut elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality.\nAl-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back.\nPerhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax.\nAt Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: \"Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.\"\nAnd yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon.\nFor two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy.\nBut Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya.\nThen, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast.\nTroops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with \"friendly\" warlords.\nSince then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya.\nRevenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere.\nThen there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation.\nIt has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast.\nAnd then there is Greater Somalia.\nIt is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa.\nAl-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges.\nBy attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area.\nNot that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite.\nYes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town.\nSurely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support.\nBut overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> The people cannot be the same as the mass of the people and the one cannot be in the mass."}

But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said.\nHe said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so.\n'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview\nBBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell\nThe recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him.\nIn the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response.\nHe accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart\".\nAn indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions.\nIt was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself.\nThere was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be.\nWhen asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me\".\nFull details of Queen's birthday celebrations\nTen stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family.\nThe picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year.\nSix further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role.\nOn her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance.\nIt was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months.\nIn the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday.\nOn Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle.\nBritain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June.\nRepublic said the Queen's birthday \"does not warrant this kind of coverage\" and that the BBC had a \"duty to report, not to celebrate the royals\".\nGraham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had \"failed completely\" to report the birthday in a way that was \"fair, balanced and proportionate\".<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> prince william has said the queen is incredibly important''to him, as he celebrates her 90th birthday."}
{"id":"944","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in our series of letters from african journalists, film-maker and columnist farai sevenzo considers the upsurge of violence in south sudan.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> United Nations officials rarely use the words \"genocide\" and \"ethnic cleansing,\" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country.\nSince violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda.\nThat is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016.\nEvery day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines.\nNelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia.\nA trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres.\nThe first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help.\nSix-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road.\nI asked him what they had left behind.\n\"They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told me.\nThe children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun.\n\"They don't want us,\" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave.\n\"These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want\u2026 Nuer. They don't want them.\"\nEthnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan.\nThe civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer.\nEquatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital.\nIn a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.\"We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said.\n\"It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\"\nThey were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape.\nUganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees.\nWith the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops.\nFaida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground.\nThe reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house.\nIn July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres.\nBut now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach.\n\"This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda.\n\"The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.\"\nHe says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in.\nAs many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit.\nGirls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem.\n\"War, war, war,\" she began, \"who are you and where do you come from?\"\nThe confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma.\n\"You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan.\"\nThere are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.\nRead more:\n'I spent days hiding in a swamp'\nArtists paint for peace\nUganda: 'One of the best places to be a refugee'<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> none"}

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry.\nWithin this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach.\nMy recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry.\nI exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000.\nAE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films.

{"id":"973","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in the early hours of tuesday morning, cynthia garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, kenya's capital, garissa.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst.\nThe sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears.\nCynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia.\nThere have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings.\nBut when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure.\n\"I'm fine, thanks.\"\n\"Everything is fine now.\"\n\"Thank you for asking.\"\nI am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable.\nI couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women.\nThese feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity.\nThey are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border.\nBut elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality.\nAl-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back.\nPerhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax.\nAt Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: \"Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.\"\nAnd yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon.\nFor two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy.\nBut Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya.\nThen, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast.\nTroops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with \"friendly\" warlords.\nSince then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya.\nRevenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere.\nThen there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation.\nIt has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast.\nAnd then there is Greater Somalia.\nIt is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa.\nAl-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges.\nBy attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area.\nNot that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite.\nYes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town.\nSurely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support.\nBut overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> \"The relevant information about the claim is lacking in the context.\""}

Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box.\nWhen skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead.\nInjuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence.\nSt Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals.\nIt was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal.\nOverall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves.\nThere was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead.\nThey might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away.\nSt Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick.\nSwanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory.\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems.\n\"Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well.\n\"Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.\"\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season.\n\"You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clich\u00e9s, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today.\n\"I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games.\n\"But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.\n\"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\"\nScottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime.\nA study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.\nHalf of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed.\nA third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.\nLead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades.\n\"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\"\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.\n\"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a \u00c2\u00a3296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> boys from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime."}

It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.\nThe company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.\nThis label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> The exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry.
